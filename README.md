# `whoami`

Hi! 👋

I’m a systems engineer who’s worked all across the stack for over a decade, with a focus on desktop and mobile platform development. I love the craft of software engineering, and think a lot about ["programming as theory building"](https://pablo.rauzy.name/dev/naur1985programming.pdf).

I have a knack for picking up new languages, but I’m really fond of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Swift](https://www.swift.org/), C/C++/Objective-C, and JavaScript.

A few years ago, I led a project to [modernize bookmark syncing in Firefox](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2018/05/14/deep-dive-new-bookmark-sync-in-nightly/). I’ve also worked on OS services that power [App Privacy Report](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102188) on iOS, and [Shared Passwords and Passkeys](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-passwords-iphe6b2b7043/ios) on iOS and macOS.

I dropped out of an English degree to write software professionally, and love connecting with other folks from non-traditional (and traditional!) backgrounds in tech.

When I’m not at a keyboard, I spend my time running, cooking, and baking; reading novels and poetry; and exploring the California coast.

Thanks for stopping by!
