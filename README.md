# `whoami`

Hi! 👋 I’m Lina (pronounced _/LEE-nuh/_).

I’ve worked across the stack for a decade, on **apps**, **frameworks**, **system services**, and **cloud servers**. I like to “make the whole widget,” from the platform to the user experience.

I love the craft of software engineering, with a focus on **distributed systems**, **syncing**, and **storing** user data. My happiest place is working at the intersection of multiple teams and technologies.

I’m a “confident dabbler”, with a knack for learning new languages and platforms, but I have a fondness for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Swift](https://www.swift.org/), (Objective-) C/C++, and JavaScript.

A few years ago, I led a project to [modernize bookmark syncing in Firefox](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2018/05/14/deep-dive-new-bookmark-sync-in-nightly/). I’ve also worked on iOS and macOS core services that power [App Privacy Report](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102188) and [Shared Passwords and Passkeys](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-passwords-iphe6b2b7043/ios).

I dropped out of an English degree to write software professionally, and love connecting with other folks from non-traditional (and traditional!) backgrounds in tech.

### 👀 Other fun facts about me

* 🏃‍♀️ I’m a long-distance runner.
* 🌉 I fall in love with just about every new city I visit, but San Francisco and the Bay Area are home.
* 👩‍🍳 I’m a keen cook and baker, and love trying out new recipes.
* ☕️ I was a tea drinker for a long time, but discovered I love coffee a few years ago.
