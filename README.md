# `whoami`

Hi! üëã I‚Äôm Lina (pronounced _/LEE-nuh/_).

I‚Äôve worked across the stack for a decade, on **apps**, **frameworks**, **system services**, and **cloud servers**. I like to ‚Äúmake the whole widget,‚Äù from the platform to the user experience.

I love the craft of software engineering, with a focus on **distributed systems**, **syncing**, and **storing** user data. My happiest place is working at the intersection of multiple teams and technologies.

I‚Äôm a ‚Äúconfident dabbler‚Äù, with a knack for learning new languages and platforms, but I have a fondness for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), [Swift](https://www.swift.org/), (Objective-) C/C++, and JavaScript.

A few years ago, I led a project to [modernize bookmark syncing in Firefox](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2018/05/14/deep-dive-new-bookmark-sync-in-nightly/). I‚Äôve also worked on iOS and macOS core services that power [App Privacy Report](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102188) and [Shared Passwords and Passkeys](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/share-passwords-iphe6b2b7043/ios).

I dropped out of an English degree to write software professionally, and love connecting with other folks from non-traditional (and traditional!) backgrounds in tech.

When I‚Äôm not at a keyboard, I spend my time running, cooking, and baking; reading poetry, novellas, and landscape histories; and exploring the beautiful San Mateo coast!

Thanks for stopping by!
